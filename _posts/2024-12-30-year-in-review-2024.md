There's this unsettling feeling as my fingers type the keyboard knowing this is the only post I have for the year 2024 on my personal blog. However, it is that time of the year again to do the annual tradition of writing a year-in-review. It's serves as an anchor of reflection for the closing year and something that I know I will use as a reference point in the next one (I know because it has done exactly that in the past two years). :boom:


## 2024 Focus Area Recap

# Do a few things better
I wanted to refine my expertise and experiences in a few areas of life (primarily the craft of writing) and career (deepening my security knowledge as a security engineer) in 2024. It feels satisfying knowing I did well on that front by pursuing writing in publications like The Pragmatic Engineer newsletter doing a 2 part series on the topic 'What is Security Engineering'- [Part1](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/security-engineering) and [Part2](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/security-engineering-part-2). Also, a few other interesting ones include authoring two chapters in the O'Reilly Media book [97 Things Every Application Security Professional Should Know](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9781098152161/) and the Dark Reading article [The Imperative for Robust Security Design in the Health Industry](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/imperative-robust-security-design-health-industry). All these gave me the experience of refining my writing, learning a bit more about writing for a broader audience and the art of editing.


# Learn and Teach
The highlight on this front for me was to be invited to give a guest lecture at the Sonoma State University's Computer Science department on the topic of 'State of Cloud Security'. Teaching has been a passion of mine and getting the opportunity to do so at an academic level was quite fulfilling.

I got to deliver a talk to a small group of smart woman in cybersecurity practitioners at the [Day of Shecurity](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nieletdmello_its-not-every-day-that-you-get-the-unique-activity-7190135166378340352-nqTz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) conference sometime earlier this year.

I did a fun brown bag session at Datadog during the [learning week](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nieletdmello_datadog-is-such-a-fun-place-to-work-last-activity-7202461310742114304-8iH6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on the topic of 'Job Crafting'.

I also served as the Co-chair for the Call for Proposals team at [The Diana Initiative conference](https://www.dianainitiative.org/) and got to learn the skill of how conference proposals process work all the way to putting together a well balanced schedule for it.

Adjacently, I collabed with Swathi Joshi to publish a template for [Security Design Reviews](https://github.com/firstprinciplesecurity/Security-Design-Review/blob/main/Template.md).

On the learning front, I embedded with the Cloud security team at Datadog for one entire quarter and towards the end, also successfully did the [AWS Certified Security â€“ Specialty](https://www.credly.com/badges/c69d0a79-2773-446b-a929-7e8cd87c0ff6/public_url) cert.

# Balanced Work-Life Integration
This one I would say I did fairly well however, there's a long way for me to go on it. I had some peaks and valleys in the pursuit of this particular goal and knowing that it is something one needs to do for a lifetime (of their career), I'll be ok exercising patience to get it right (mostly).
I now know what works for me and what does not and the real skill would be to harness my understanding of it on a regular such that it will show up in maintaining the quality of my life in terms of wellness, satisfaction, meaningful relationships and happiness.
I spent real quality outdoor time this year and focused my travels on personal front instead of more professional ones.


## 2025 Focus Areas

# Do a few things better
In the spirit of keeping the same high level goal, I'd like to set my eyes upon optimizing for depth and maintaining consistency in what I choose to pursue.
This would mean looking for opportunities that will let me take my skills from what I have done in 2024 one step further, one level deeper.

# Learn and Teach
My commitment to learning and teaching persists and now I know I got the chops to do that too. So, I'd be looking to explore creating a structured format to teach.

# Deep focus and a better reading routine
I want to carve out focused time to engage in creative activities that demand deep work. Also, I'd look to re-establish and re-cultivate my reading habit and behaviors to read at longer stretches of time.
